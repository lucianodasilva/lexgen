lexgen
======

Small grammar generator for C++11.

This small tool was written as part of a larger project and is intended
to make writing small generic parsers easier by emulating an 
Extended Backusâ€“Naur Form syntax.

Its usage was largely influenced by boost::spirit but at a microscopic scale.

Please check the tokenizer.cpp example project for an idea on its usage.
